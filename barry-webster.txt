Stretch Review questions: 
1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? 
An inline element can have content on its left and right side. It only takes as much width as necessary. Multiple inline elements can exist on the same line if there’s space. A block element cannot have content on its left or right side. It fills the entire line from left to right taking up the entire width of the page if the width is not specified.

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default, and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
